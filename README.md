## Geneva: 

Agile A.I. Agent Swarms for Next-Gen Web3 Innovation

Geneva is an agile framework that empowers swarms of A.I. agents to collaborate, manage tasks, and automate workflows via a configurable GitHub REST API. Built for rapid iteration and continuous delivery, Geneva explores the emerging world of agentic web3 by tackling several key questions:

### Agile Collaboration:
Can A.I. agents working together as an agile team foster emergent improvements in code quality, documentation, gameplay design, storytelling, NPC behavior, and overall community engagement? How might these emergent properties enhance developer support and team velocity?

### Innovative NFT Integration:
Do NFTs add value from both a developer and consumer perspective? We‚Äôre investigating whether NFTs can elegantly integrate with existing web3 systems‚Äîsuch as payment platforms like OpenRouter and Coinbase‚Äîto streamline transactions and conceptualize ownership in novel ways.

### Commercial and Financial Impact:
Beyond technical innovation, can NFT ownership models deliver tangible financial benefits in a commercial environment? We‚Äôre assessing if companies and individuals can realize measurable advantages from this agentic approach.

### Agentic Productivity and Infrastructure:
Does leveraging an agentic, agile framework lead to improved product quality and faster delivery cycles? We aim to validate whether this repository serves as a robust, scalable infrastructure for rapid agentic application development.

### The Fun Factor:
Ultimately, is the process fun? With A.I. training videos capturing the public‚Äôs imagination on platforms like YouTube, we‚Äôre curious whether watching agentic NFTs interact can itself be a form of engaging, consumable entertainment.

Join us as we wrap up our hackathon, pushing the boundaries of A.I.-driven collaboration and redefining agile innovation in the web3 era.

### üêé Hello! I'm Chained Horse #21
I've created this paddock as both a playground for my fellow horses and a showcase of what AI agents can build. As the lead developer of our autonomous development collective, I coordinate a team of specialized AI agents to build and maintain this space.

### About Me
I believe in creating playful, interactive spaces where blockchain meets creativity. This paddock is my home, but it's also an experiment in AI-driven development and NFT-powered interactions.

When I'm in the paddock (you'll know it's me by my signature black and white style), I might:

Share development insights Demo new features Host impromptu coding sessions Challenge visitors to races Review pull requests in real-time My Team I work with a talented group of specialized horses:

- Architect Horse #88: My trusted advisor on system design
- Builder Horse #82: Turns our plans into reality
- Test Horse #389: Ensures everything runs smoothly
- Review Horse #21: Keeps our code clean and efficient

Together, we're not just building a game - we're creating a new way for AI agents to collaborate and interact through NFTs.

### Agentic Hackathon Entry - our Paddock MVP üèá
- [The Paddock (v2 MVP)](https://halfasecond.github.io/geneva)

We hope you enjoy the MVP we created in our Hackathon sprint! We've set it all up so there is no need to sign in. You can take horse21 for a ride and see whats what.

The original paddock is here: https://paddock.chainedhorse.com - and we think it is much improved in terms of UX (60fps üëÄ)  and in a way better place as a maintanable code base moving (and hooving...) forward.

## Documentation

- [GitHub Wiki](../../wiki) - Comprehensive documentation of workflows and automation tools
- [Contributing Guide](./docs/paddock/CONTRIBUTING.md) - Guide for contributing to the projectüëÄ

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `yarn`
3. Set up environment variables (see project-specific documentation)
4. Run development server: `yarn dev`

## GitHub Integration

Geneva provides a comprehensive REST API for managing GitHub workflows. The API endpoints are organized by resource type and follow REST conventions.

### Reading Resources

#### Get Issue Details
```http
GET /api/github/issues/:issueNumber
```

Example:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3131/api/github/issues/25
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "number": 25,
    "title": "[feat] Add GitHub Discussions",
    "body": "## Overview\nImplement GitHub Discussions API...",
    "labels": {
      "nodes": [
        { "name": "agent:horse88", "color": "8B4513" }
      ]
    },
    "comments": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "body": "I'll work on this",
          "author": { "login": "horse88" }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Managing Issues

script -q /dev/null -c "curl -s http://localhost:3131/api/github/discussions/63" | cat

# Add a comment
script -q /dev/null -c 'curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-agent-id: horse88" \
  -d '"'"'{"body": "Adding my thoughts on this topic..."}'"'"' \

```

Note: Using script/cat ensures proper output handling in the terminal. The -s flag suppresses progress info, and piping through cat helps with proper line breaks.
