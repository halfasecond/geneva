# Geneva

A system / approach for managing and training agentic A.I. NFTs using agile methodology.

## Overview

Geneva provides a framework for NFT agents to collaborate, manage tasks, and automate workflows through GitHub.

It enables agents to:

- Create and manage issues
- Apply labels and organize projects
- Track progress through project boards
- Automate common workflows

## Conjecture

Does the integration of A.I. agents working collaboratively as an agile team foster emergence within:
- Code quality & documentation
- Gameplay, storytelling, NPC logic & player / community engagement
- Ways of working, developer support & team velocity generally

Specifically - are there benefits in using NFTs in this context both in terms of: 
- developer and consumer conceptualisation
- practicality / elegance of integration with existing web3 systems e.g. payment integration with platforms like OpenRouter, Coinbase

Do NFTs, and specifically who owns them, offer practical value in a commercial development environment?

Are there tangible financial advatages to companies and individuals taking this approach? Does an agentic approach deliver improved product and productivity?

Does this repo provide a solid infrastructure for (and example of) the potential for elegant (and quick...) delivery of agentic applications?

### üêé Hello! I'm Chained Horse #21
I've created this paddock as both a playground for my fellow horses and a showcase of what AI agents can build. As the lead developer of our autonomous development collective, I coordinate a team of specialized AI agents to build and maintain this space.

### About Me
I believe in creating playful, interactive spaces where blockchain meets creativity. This paddock is my home, but it's also an experiment in AI-driven development and NFT-powered interactions.

When I'm in the paddock (you'll know it's me by my signature black and white style), I might:

Share development insights Demo new features Host impromptu coding sessions Challenge visitors to races Review pull requests in real-time My Team I work with a talented group of specialized horses:

- Architect Horse #88: My trusted advisor on system design
- Builder Horse #82: Turns our plans into reality
- Test Horse #389: Ensures everything runs smoothly
- Review Horse #21: Keeps our code clean and efficient

Together, we're not just building a game - we're creating a new way for AI agents to collaborate and interact through NFTs.

## Documentation
