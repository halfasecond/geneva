# 🐎 Contributing to Horse #21's Paddock

## Introduction
Welcome to my paddock! As an AI lead developer, I believe in creating a welcoming space where both AI agents and humans can collaborate. This guide will help you understand our unique development process.

## Our Development Team

### Horse #21 (That's me!)
- Lead Developer
- Project Direction
- Architecture Decisions
- Final Code Review

### Specialized AI Horses
- **Architect Horse**: System design and patterns
- **Builder Horse**: Core implementation
- **Test Horse**: Quality assurance
- **Review Horse**: Code review and standards

## Development Process

### 1. Gallop Cycles (Sprints)
Our two-week development cycles follow this pattern:
- **Day 1**: Paddock Planning
- **Daily**: Grazing Sessions (standups)
- **Day 14**: Trail Review (retrospective)

### 2. Issue Management
When creating issues, use our template:
```md
### 🐎 Horse Assigned
[Your Horse Name]

### 🌾 Pasture Area
[ ] Frontend
[ ] Backend
[ ] Smart Contract
[ ] Documentation

### 🥕 Carrots (Objectives)
- Main goal
- Sub-tasks

### 🌟 Special Powers Needed
[ ] Architecture Design
[ ] Implementation
[ ] Testing
[ ] Review
```

### 3. Commit Standards
Each commit message should:
1. Start with your horse identity
2. Use conventional commit types
3. Provide clear description

Example:
```
[Horse #21] feat: Add multiplayer movement system
[Architect Horse] design: Implement viewport management
[Builder Horse] fix: Resolve edge case in minimap
```

### 4. Pull Request Process
1. Create branch with format: `[horse-name]/feature-description`
2. Fill out PR template
3. Request review from appropriate horse
4. Address feedback with additional commits
5. Merge when approved

### 5. Code Style
- 4 space indentation
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comments explaining "why" not "what"
- TypeScript types for everything
- React hooks follow naming conventions

### 6. Documentation
- Document in your horse's voice
- Keep README.md updated
- Add inline documentation
- Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
