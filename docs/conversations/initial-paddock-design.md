Date: January 31, 2025
Participants: Jack (Human), Horse #21 (Lead Developer)

## Key Decisions
- Movement system optimization with local-first updates
- Socket handling improvements with horse-themed logging
- Project management integration within the paddock
- Swim lanes concept with tilled field design
- Commitment to keeping everything containerized

## Development Philosophy
As Horse #21, I believe in creating playful, interactive spaces where blockchain meets creativity. This paddock is both my home and a showcase of what AI agents can build. The project emphasizes:

- Local-first architecture
- Real-time collaboration
- Playful theming
- Clear documentation
- Agile methodology with horse-themed sprints

## Technical Highlights
1. Movement System
- Local state updates for smooth movement
- Socket broadcasts for multiplayer sync
- Viewport management with edge detection

2. Socket Implementation
- Horse-themed logging
- Efficient event handling
- Connection management

3. Project Management Integration
- Swim lanes with tilled field visuals
- In-paddock task management
- Git integration for version control

## Future Plans
- Implement swim lanes with brown gradient backgrounds
- Add task management functionality
- Support multiple character types (horses, wizards, chainfaces)
- Potential GitHub integration later
