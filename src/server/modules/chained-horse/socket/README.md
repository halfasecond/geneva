# Multiplayer Game Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers the architecture of our socket-based multiplayer game system, focusing on performance, scalability, and real-time synchronization.

## Core Documentation

1. [Socket Architecture](docs/socket-architecture.md)
   - Current implementation
   - Scaling strategies
   - Performance configuration
   - Future considerations

2. [Tick Configuration](docs/tick-configuration.md)
   - Server-side ticks
   - Client throttling
   - Performance implications
   - Scaling considerations

3. [Game Server Architecture](docs/game-server-architecture.md)
   - Server components
   - Scaling strategy
   - Performance monitoring
   - Deployment architecture

## Key Features

### Current Implementation
- WebSocket-based communication
- 10 updates/second base rate
- Client-side throttling
- CSS-based smoothing
- Dynamic settings

### Performance
- Configurable tick rates
- Frame-based throttling
- Network optimization
- State management

### Scalability
- Multi-instance support
- Regional deployment
- Load balancing
- State synchronization

## Technical Highlights

### Socket Communication
```typescript
const gameSettings = {
    tickRate: 100,        // 10 updates/second
    movementSpeed: 3.75,  // pixels/frame
    broadcastFrames: 5,   // Client throttling
    smoothing: 0.1        // Animation smoothing
};
```

### Performance Metrics
- Connection count
- Update frequency
- Network latency
- State size

### Scaling Capabilities
- Dynamic instance creation
- Regional distribution
- Load-based settings
- Resource optimization

## Future Development

### Short Term
1. Basic monitoring
2. Regional settings
3. Performance metrics
4. Load testing

### Medium Term
1. Dynamic tick rates
2. Advanced throttling
3. Client prediction
4. Regional optimization

### Long Term
1. Machine learning integration
2. Predictive scaling
3. Advanced state management
4. Cross-region optimization

## Implementation Notes

### Current Configuration
- Base tick rate: 100ms
- Client updates: Every 5th frame
- Movement speed: 3.75 pixels/frame
- Smooth transitions: 0.1s

### Monitoring
- Active connections
- Message throughput
- State size
- Network metrics

### Optimization
- Load-based adjustments
- Regional tuning
- Client-side prediction
- State compression

## Getting Started

1. Review [Socket Architecture](docs/socket-architecture.md) for system overview
2. Check [Tick Configuration](docs/tick-configuration.md) for performance settings
3. See [Game Server Architecture](docs/game-server-architecture.md) for deployment details

## Contributing

When making changes:
1. Consider performance implications
2. Test with varying player counts
3. Verify network behavior
4. Document configuration changes
